ship class
	nav system
		active — boolean
		calibrated — boolean
		remaining power — PowerCore

	life sys
		food output — int (0-100, empty-full)
		remaining fertilizer — int (0-100, empty-full)
		remaining power — PowerCore
		grow (Powercore, Fertilizer) — void
			takes energy from power core and fertilizer to 			produce a certain amount of soylent

	disposal (implemented)
		waste — int (0-100, empty-full)
		water — int (0-100, empty-full)
		soylent — int (0-100, empty-full)
		fertilizer — int (0-100, empty-full)
		inbetween — int (0-100, empty-full)
		// water + soylent can only total to 100, waste + 			// inbetween can only total to 100, fertilizer can go 		// up to 100 by itself
		remaining power — PowerCore
		filter (Powercore) — void
			decrease waste by .25 factor and increases 				inbetween, then decrease energy level in 				powercore by factor of .75
		distill (Powercore) — void
			decrease waste by .75 factor and increases 				water, then decrease energy level in 					powercore by factor of .75
		process (Powercore) — void
			decrease inbetween by a 1.0 factor and 				increase fertilizer by 1.0 factor, then decrease 			energy level by 1.0 factor
	propulsion
		active? — boolean (if false, power-draw = 0, else…)
		warp factor — int (0-10, not moving-lightspeed)
		power-draw — int (0-10, no draw-maximum draw)
		efficiency — int (0-1, initialized @ 0.5, can use .1 			(efficient)-1 (inefficient)
		remaining power — PowerCore

powercore class
	volatility — chance of sys breaking down every 10 		minutes
	remaining energy — how long sys can stay running
	type — which ship sys to plug into

auto-nav
—> calibration — trajectory is incorrect, how do we re-align 	the ship?

	instruction manual has formulas to re-aligning trajectory
	engineer would tell command that there’s something		wrong and command would try to help them
	spherical coords, estimate —> iterative process

	guesses (X, Y, Z) == (A, B, C) - win

	objective is to perfect trajectory estimate by matching 	the “values”

	the formula in the instructions is 1-1, so that the game 	code translates the engineer’s input back into a 3D 		vector, and then displays the 3D vector if is an incorrect 	estimate

	cantor’s

—> navigation sys fail error : reboot process, how do we 		restart the nav system?

	series of pulling out and re-arranging fuses?



life support
—> growing plants

ion drive

mass drivers — propulsion
—> top warp — tier-based achievement (while user is not busy keeping ship running)

	series of puzzles to solve in order to either increase 		energy efficiency of the drivers or increase the power 		output of the drivers to reach destination with greater 		fuel left for return journey or to reach destination faster 	or both :)

	puzzles:

	discrete reasoning:
	—> correct sequence of electromagnets — can be 		randomized
		electromagnets A, B, and C
		command has certain instructions that say: 		“A must come first, B comes second” — one part 		of the statement is true and the other is false
		“C must come first, A comes second” — one part 		of the statement is true and the other is false
		sol: if A does not come first or B is not second, and  		C is not first or and A is not second, then the order 		is: C, B, A

	—>
disposal unit
—> sanitation — to maintain a constant amount of water and food, we need to correctly process the waste (filter, distill, and purge (flush))

	engineer has to relay the levels of “waste,” “fresh 		water,” “soylent,” “fertilizer,” and “in-between material”	to command and on certain thresholds of each variable 	given on the guide, the engineer is told to either filter, 		distill, and/or process in a certain order for a certain 		number of times

	ex: we have 30% fresh water left, 20% soylent, and 50% 	waste. first we have to filter twice, which brings us to 		30% water, 20% soylent, 10% waste, and 40% in-			between material (doing these operations is taxing to 		energy levels); once we are at 40% in-between material, 	we distill to bring us to +30% water —> 60% water, 20% 	soylent, and 10% waste, and 10% in-between material. 	we then filter the last 10% of in-between material to 		achieve —> 60% water, 20% soylent, 10% waste, and 		10% fertilizer

	function lifeSupport (freshWater, soylent, waste, fertilizer) {
	this.freshWater = freshWater;
	this.soylent = soylent;
	this.waste = waste;
	this.fertilizer = fertilizer;
}
	function SpaceShip (
	filter: function(ship) {}

	distill: function(ship) {}

	purge: function(ship) {}


power core
—> replace energy source — the uranium fuel sources have different levels of volatility, remaining energy, and type (constant upkeep, sustenance gameplay)

	to extract the correct power core, series of head-			movements are required (almost like key-combination)

	command has to communicate with the engineer to 		select which power core is best based on current 		spaceship vitality and usage case, command will help 		engineer extract correct fuel source and how to handle/	insert

	ex: volatility — engineer must be very precise and 		gentle in movements

	ex: remaining energy — which power core is best to 		use? less remaining life in fuel source = switch more 		often, more = more volatile

	ex: type — some fuel sources are best for power life 		support systems, some are best for powering the ion-		drive for warping
